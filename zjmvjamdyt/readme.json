{"id":"zjmvjamdyt","title":"Audio Event Detection","author":"Satyam Singh","categoryId":13,"description":"This Python project provides a class (AudioDetection) for detecting specific audio events within a larger audio file. It leverages the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to analyze the frequency content of the audio signals and a similarity-based matching algorithm to identify the occurrence of target events.\n\nProvide BOX links for below inputs.\n\nsource_file: File where detection will happen\nmatching_file: File that is the event\n\nIf no files are available to you, use below links of sample files. Before using them in asset, have a listen.\nsource_file: https://ibm.box.com/s/tj3j60x09krxs9n7bevwm07wett4mz7b\nmatching_file: https://ibm.box.com/s/zlppoegegja4wzbxe25bpabbelwf9yjv","typeId":1,"type":"python","fileName":"cookbook_audio_event_detection.py","source":"git","assetURL":"https://github.ibm.com/Satyam-Singh3/audio_event_detection","userId":"66618ac4-adcd-4b9f-8f60-8df31427eadd","preRequisites":{"fields":[{"type":"text","label":"source_file"},{"type":"text","label":"matching_file"}],"requiredFields":[["source_file","matching_file"]],"installDependencyCommands":["pip install librosa scipy==1.13.1 numpy==1.26.4"]},"createdTimestamp":1719228786202,"updatedTimestamp":1719501432486}
