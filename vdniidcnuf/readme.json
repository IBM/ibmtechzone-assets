It processes audio files in various formats (e.g., wav, mp3, flac, ogg), chunks large files for transcription, and uses a specified speech model to generate transcripts with speaker labels. The transcriptions are then saved and uploaded to the IBM Watson Studio project. Additionally, the notebook integrates an LLM for advanced language processing tasks, offering flexibility in model configuration and parameter tuning.","typeId":1,"type":"python","fileName":"https://github.ibm.com/Ayushi-Parida/Audio-Transcription-and-Ambient-Documentation-using-IBM-Watson-Speech-to-Text-and-LLM/blob/main/audio_transcription_notebook.py","source":"git","assetURL":"https://github.ibm.com/Ayushi-Parida/Audio-Transcription-and-Ambient-Documentation-using-IBM-Watson-Speech-to-Text-and-LLM","userId":"73dad5ee-eb6e-4a1a-8356-6cffefa8c855","preRequisites":{"fields":[],"requiredFields":[[]],"installDependencyCommands":[""]},"createdTimestamp":1727534013054,"updatedTimestamp":1727534013054}
