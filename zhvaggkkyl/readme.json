It leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing models, such as sentence-transformers, to handle search queries for asset retrieval, focusing on metadata like authors, descriptions, and technical keywords. The search system also supports entity extraction and searches for AWS-specific assets like S3-compliant buckets, enhancing the relevance of search results. Additionally, the project uses IBM Watson Machine Learning for enhanced search capabilities.","typeId":1,"type":"python","fileName":"https://github.ibm.com/Siva-Santosh-S/assethub/blob/milvus-enhancements-v4/app/main.py","source":"git","assetURL":"https://github.ibm.com/Siva-Santosh-S/assethub/tree/milvus-enhancements-v4","userId":"716a1d9c-165d-44a8-9038-971813a3b281","preRequisites":{"fields":[],"requiredFields":[[]],"installDependencyCommands":[""]},"createdTimestamp":1727700447330,"updatedTimestamp":1727700447330}
