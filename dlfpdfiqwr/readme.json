{"id":"dlfpdfiqwr","title":"ColBERT Reranker","documentationURL":"none","author":"Abhijeet Gorai","categoryId":12,"description":"This Python class, ColbertReranker, leverages the ColBERT model for reranking documents based on their relevance to a query. Using Huggingface's AutoTokenizer and AutoModel, the class tokenizes and encodes both queries and document texts, calculating similarity scores via cosine similarity between embeddings. The rerank method processes a list of documents, computes relevance scores, and returns the documents sorted by relevance. Ideal for information retrieval tasks requiring fine-grained reranking of documents.","typeId":1,"type":"python","fileName":"dlfpdfiqwr.py","source":"local","assetURL":"","userId":"d6be855f-9ff8-4ad3-a044-d35fadf47980","preRequisites":{"fields":[],"requiredFields":[[]],"installDependencyCommands":["pip install langchain"," pip install transformers"," pip install torch"]},"createdTimestamp":1726219337321,"updatedTimestamp":1726219337321}
