{"id":"jqoicgybsm","title":"Knowledge Triples Extraction using Llama ","author":"Shravani R","categoryId":13,"description":"Knowledge Triples are fundamental components of Knowledge Graphs. They consist of three parts: subject, predicate, and object. These triples encode factual information in a structured format, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of knowledge. Ontologies provide a formal representation of knowledge within a specific domain, typically organized hierarchically with defined relationships between concepts. Extracting triples from ontologies involves parsing the ontology's structure and identifying relationships between entities to form triples.","typeId":1,"type":"python","fileName":"Knowledge Triple Llama /knowledge_triple_Llama.py","source":"local","assetURL":"","userId":"b3973f48-0acb-42b9-9372-f11dc4cc4f7c","preRequisites":{"fields":[],"requiredFields":[[]],"installDependencyCommands":["pip install os"," pip install networkx"," pip install pyvis"," pip install gradio"," pip install langchain"," pip install typing"," pip install pydantic"," pip install ibm_watson_machine_learning"]},"createdTimestamp":1713966858084,"updatedTimestamp":1713966858084}
