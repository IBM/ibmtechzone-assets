{"id":"cljeeycmng","title":"Getting Started with Watson Document Understanding","author":"Mula Ram Chamar","categoryId":12,"description":"Enterprise Business Documents are usually distributed in PDF/Word/Image formats for ease of document exchange, printing, human consumption and archival. While there have been significant advances in NLP/AI models for language understanding, applying these techniques over business documents faces a significant hurdle - the models work over text and not directly on PDF/Word/Image formats.\n\nDocument Conversion is the task of converting business documents into a \"rich-text\" format (JSON, HTML, etc.) for NLP/AI driven understanding of its contents. By retaining textual content and document structure such as sections and tables, document conversion standardizes business content into an intermediate format, opening up deeper understanding of the semantics for a variety of enterprise applications.\n\nWatson Document Understanding is a standard embeddable library designed to be the primary delivery method for state-of-the-art document conversion in IBM products. It is an inner source library built on top of the best AI OSS enhanced with input from Research, Watson Discovery, Automation and GBS. Watson Document Understanding is a component of Watson Core, and it is developed under Watson Coreâ€™s inner source model.","typeId":1,"type":"python","fileName":"","source":"git","assetURL":"https://github.ibm.com/Mukesh-M2/getting-started-with-wdu","userId":"6bbf5fdf-4dd8-44fe-9948-faf3e7232428","preRequisites":{"fields":[],"requiredFields":[[]],"installDependencyCommands":[""]},"createdTimestamp":1716449172764,"updatedTimestamp":1716449172764}
