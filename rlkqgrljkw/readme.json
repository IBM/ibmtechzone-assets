This check is crucial in industries like the automobile sector, where clear requirements help avoid costly rework and schedule delays.\n\nHow did we build the INCOSE checker?\nWe developed the INCOSE checker to cover all 42 rules dependent on Characteristics and Patterns by promptuning the Llama3 model using WatsonX AI. We used two columns—Unacceptable Statement and Acceptable Statement—to train the model, ensuring it can effectively validate need and requirement statements.","typeId":1,"type":"python","fileName":"","source":"git","assetURL":"https://github.ibm.com/aakriti-aggarwal13/INCOSE","userId":"ad0909ac-79ab-4f83-b6e5-8a8d45268e31","preRequisites":{"fields":[],"requiredFields":[[]],"installDependencyCommands":[""]},"createdTimestamp":1716456684597,"updatedTimestamp":1716456684597}
