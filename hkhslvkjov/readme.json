It leverages IBM's Watsonx LLM for natural language processing and HuggingFace's MiniLM for text embeddings. The system is designed to index and query agricultural data stored in JSON format, with knowledge graph storage handled by Neo4j.","typeId":1,"type":"python","fileName":"https://github.ibm.com/Client-Eng-EMEA-IN/graph-rag-agriculture-usecase/blob/main/server.py","source":"git","assetURL":"https://github.ibm.com/Client-Eng-EMEA-IN/graph-rag-agriculture-usecase","userId":"393bd77f-9fb6-4448-a41b-4de228dfb0b9","preRequisites":{"fields":[],"requiredFields":[[]],"installDependencyCommands":["Flask==3.0.3"," Flask_Cors==4.0.1"," ibm_watson_machine_learning==1.0.359"," ibm_watsonx_ai==1.1.2"," langchain==0.2.14"," langchain_community==0.2.12"," langchain_ibm==0.1.12"," llama_index==0.11.1"," pandas==2.2.2"," Requests==2.32.3"," rouge==1.0.1"," sentence_transformers==3.0.1"," xlwt==1.3.0"]},"createdTimestamp":1727330350444,"updatedTimestamp":1727330537527}
