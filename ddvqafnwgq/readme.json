{"id":"ddvqafnwgq","title":"Knowledge Triples Extraction from Unstructured Data","author":"Shravani R","categoryId":13,"description":"Knowledge Triples are fundamental components of Knowledge Graphs. They consist of three parts: subject, predicate, and object. These triples encode factual information in a structured format, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of knowledge. Ontologies provide a formal representation of knowledge within a specific domain, typically organised hierarchically with defined relationships between concepts. Extracting triples from ontologies involves parsing the ontology's structure and identifying relationships between entities to form triples.\n\nSteps Involved:\nOntology Parsing: We parse the ontology to extract relevant information such as classes, properties, and relationships.\nKnowledge Triple Extraction: Based on the ontology structure, we generate triples by identifying subject, predicate, and object entities.\n\n","typeId":1,"type":"python","fileName":"Knowledge Triples/knowledge_triples_extraction.py","source":"local","assetURL":"","userId":"b3973f48-0acb-42b9-9372-f11dc4cc4f7c","preRequisites":{"fields":[{"type":"text","label":"api_key"}],"requiredFields":[["api_key"]],"installDependencyCommands":["pip install os"," pip install re"," pip install json"," pip install transformers"," pip install genai"," pip install ast "]},"createdTimestamp":1713871537049,"updatedTimestamp":1713871537049}
