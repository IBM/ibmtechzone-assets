It generates embeddings for both resumes and the job description, indexes them using FAISS, and retrieves the most relevant resumes by calculating Euclidean distance between their embeddings. The results are exported in JSON or CSV format, displaying names and similarity scores for easy analysis. The script is modular, allowing for flexible input and model configurations.","typeId":1,"type":"python","fileName":"opguczpocr.py","source":"local","assetURL":"","userId":"c77015c9-755d-4acf-b6e2-66a13a764c83","preRequisites":{"fields":[],"requiredFields":[[]],"installDependencyCommands":["pip install numpy faiss-cpu sentence-transformers"]},"createdTimestamp":1727425585680,"updatedTimestamp":1727425585680}
