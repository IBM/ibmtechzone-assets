{"id":"fbfdmkikox","title":"Context aware Chatbot w Summarization","documentationURL":"https://github.ibm.com/client-engineering-japan/asset-wizard/blob/kanishk-dev/scripts/chatbot/README.md","author":"Kanishk Saxena","categoryId":1,"description":"This Chatbot is designed to showcase how WatsonX AI can be used to create a much more accuracte answers using Langchain memory module. Leveraging Conversational Summary Buffer Memory from Langchain with Watsonx.ai enables the creation of an efficient chatbot that remembers context across interactions. The summary buffer maintains key conversation points, providing continuity in the dialogue without overwhelming memory. Integrating Watsonx.ai enhances this by allowing the chatbot to process large amounts of data, improving contextual understanding and response accuracy. As the conversation grows, Watsonx.ai helps the bot generate concise summaries, preserving relevant details while optimizing performance. This approach enables a more human-like and personalized interaction, as the chatbot evolves and adapts based on prior conversations, enhancing user experience.","typeId":1,"type":"python","fileName":"scripts/chatbot/main.py","source":"git","assetURL":"https://github.ibm.com/client-engineering-japan/asset-wizard.git","userId":"776f55ca-6a26-477d-953c-6a0ac55aef29","preRequisites":{"fields":[{"type":"text","label":"WATSONX_APIKEY"},{"type":"text","label":"PROJECT_ID"}],"requiredFields":[["watsonx_apikey","project_id"]],"installDependencyCommands":["pip install aiofiles==23.2.1","aiohttp==3.9.5","aiosignal==1.3.1","altair==5.3.0","annotated-types==0.7.0","anyio==4.4.0","appnope==0.1.4","asgiref==3.8.1","asttokens==2.4.1","attrs==23.2.0","backoff==2.2.1","bcrypt==4.1.3","build==1.2.1","cachetools==5.3.3","certifi==2024.6.2","charset-normalizer==3.3.2","chroma-hnswlib==0.7.3","chromadb==0.5.0","ci-info==0.3.0","click==8.1.7","coloredlogs==15.0.1","comm==0.2.2","configobj==5.0.8","configparser==7.0.0","contourpy==1.2.1","cycler==0.12.1","dataclasses-json==0.6.7","debugpy==1.8.1","decorator==5.1.1","Deprecated==1.2.14","distro==1.9.0","dnspython==2.6.1","email_validator==2.1.1","et-xmlfile==1.1.0","etelemetry==0.3.1","executing==2.0.1","fastapi==0.111.0","fastapi-cli==0.0.4","ffmpy==0.3.2","filelock==3.15.1","fitz==0.0.1.dev2","flatbuffers==24.3.25","fonttools==4.53.0","frontend==0.0.3","frozenlist==1.4.1","fsspec==2024.6.0","google-auth==2.30.0","googleapis-common-protos==1.63.1","gradio==4.36.1","gradio_client==1.0.1","grpcio==1.64.1","h11==0.14.0","httpcore==1.0.5","httplib2==0.22.0","httptools==0.6.1","httpx==0.27.0","huggingface-hub==0.23.4","humanfriendly==10.0","ibm-cos-sdk==2.13.5","ibm-cos-sdk-core==2.13.5","ibm-cos-sdk-s3transfer==2.13.5","ibm_watson_machine_learning==1.0.360","ibm_watsonx_ai==1.0.8","idna==3.7","importlib_metadata==7.1.0","importlib_resources==6.4.0","ipykernel==6.29.4","ipython==8.25.0","isodate==0.6.1","itsdangerous==2.2.0","jedi==0.19.1","Jinja2==3.1.4","jmespath==1.0.1","joblib==1.4.2","jsonpatch==1.33","jsonpointer==3.0.0","jsonschema==4.22.0","jsonschema-specifications==2023.12.1","jupyter_client==8.6.2","jupyter_core==5.7.2","kiwisolver==1.4.5","kubernetes==30.1.0","langchain==0.2.5","langchain-community==0.2.5","langchain-core==0.2.7","langchain-ibm==0.1.7","langchain-text-splitters==0.2.1","langdetect==1.0.9","langsmith==0.1.77","lomond==0.3.3","looseversion==1.3.0","lxml==5.2.2","markdown-it-py==3.0.0","MarkupSafe==2.1.5","marshmallow==3.21.3","matplotlib==3.9.0","matplotlib-inline==0.1.7","mdurl==0.1.2","mmh3==4.1.0","monotonic==1.6","mpmath==1.3.0","multidict==6.0.5","mypy-extensions==1.0.0","nest-asyncio==1.6.0","networkx==3.3","nibabel==5.2.1","nipype==1.8.6","numpy==1.26.4","oauthlib==3.2.2","onnxruntime==1.18.0","openai==1.34.0","openpyxl==3.1.4","opentelemetry-api==1.25.0","opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-common==1.25.0","opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc==1.25.0","opentelemetry-instrumentation==0.46b0","opentelemetry-instrumentation-asgi==0.46b0","opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi==0.46b0","opentelemetry-proto==1.25.0","opentelemetry-sdk==1.25.0","opentelemetry-semantic-conventions==0.46b0","opentelemetry-util-http==0.46b0","orjson==3.10.5","overrides==7.7.0","packaging==24.1","pandas==2.1.4","parso==0.8.4","pathlib==1.0.1","pexpect==4.9.0","pillow==10.3.0","platformdirs==4.2.2","posthog==3.5.0","prompt_toolkit==3.0.47","protobuf==4.25.3","prov==2.0.1","psutil==5.9.8","ptyprocess==0.7.0","pure-eval==0.2.2","pyasn1==0.6.0","pyasn1_modules==0.4.0","pydantic==2.7.4","pydantic_core==2.18.4","pydot==2.0.0","pydub==0.25.1","Pygments==2.18.0","PyMuPDF==1.24.5","PyMuPDFb==1.24.3","pyparsing==3.1.2","pypdf==4.3.1","PyPDF2==3.0.1","PyPika==0.48.9","pyproject_hooks==1.1.0","python-dateutil==2.9.0.post0","python-dotenv==1.0.1","python-multipart==0.0.9","pytils==0.4.1","pytz==2024.1","pyxnat==1.6.2","PyYAML==6.0.1","pyzmq==26.0.3","rdflib==6.3.2","referencing==0.35.1","regex==2024.5.15","requests==2.32.3","requests-oauthlib==2.0.0","rich==13.7.1","rpds-py==0.18.1","rsa==4.9","ruff==0.4.9","safetensors==0.4.3","scikit-learn==1.5.0","scipy==1.13.1","semantic-version==2.10.0","sentence-transformers==3.0.1","shellingham==1.5.4","simplejson==3.19.2","six==1.16.0","sniffio==1.3.1","SQLAlchemy==2.0.30","stack-data==0.6.3","starlette==0.37.2","sympy==1.12.1","tabulate==0.9.0","tenacity==8.3.0","threadpoolctl==3.5.0","tiktoken==0.7.0","tokenizers==0.19.1","tomlkit==0.12.0","tools==0.1.9","toolz==0.12.1","torch==2.0.0","tornado==6.4.1","tqdm==4.66.4","traitlets==5.14.3","traits==6.3.2","transformers==4.41.2","typer==0.12.3","typing-inspect==0.9.0","typing_extensions==4.12.2","tzdata==2024.1","ujson==5.10.0","urllib3==2.1.0","uvicorn==0.30.1","uvloop==0.19.0","watchfiles==0.22.0","wcwidth==0.2.13","websocket-client==1.8.0","websockets==11.0.3","wrapt==1.16.0","yarl==1.9.4","zipp==3.19.2"]},"createdTimestamp":1725962171708,"updatedTimestamp":1725978525275}
