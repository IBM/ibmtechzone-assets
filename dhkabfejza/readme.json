{"id":"dhkabfejza","title":"RAG Evaluation using Trulens","author":"Abhijeet Gorai","categoryId":1,"description":"This asset facilitates the evaluation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using the Trulens framework and Watsonx LLM. Leveraging the MS Marco dataset, this asset provides a comprehensive evaluation based on the RAG triad of metrics, ensuring robust assessment of the RAG pipeline's performance.\n\nKey Features:\n1. Evaluation Framework: Utilizes the Trulens framework for detailed evaluation, offering insights into the effectiveness and efficiency of the RAG pipeline.\n2. Watsonx LLM Integration: Integrates Watsonx Large Language Model to enhance the evaluation process, providing state-of-the-art language understanding and generation capabilities.\n3. User-Friendly Interface: Generates a Streamlit UI link upon running the code, allowing users to easily view and interact with the evaluation results.\n\nHow to Use:\n1. Run the Code: Execute the provided code to initiate the evaluation process.\n2. Access the Results: Upon completion, Trulens provides a link to a Streamlit UI.\n3. View the Evaluation: Open the Streamlit link in your browser to view and analyze the evaluation results.","typeId":1,"type":"python","fileName":"evaluation.py","source":"git","assetURL":"https://github.ibm.com/Abhijeet-Gorai/rag-evaluation-trulens","userId":"497c8767-dd1e-4373-a415-776661e6f25d","preRequisites":{"fields":[{"type":"password","label":"GENAI_KEY"},{"type":"text","label":"GENAI_API"}],"requiredFields":[["genai_key","genai_api"]],"installDependencyCommands":["pip install -r rag-evaluation-trulens/requirements.txt"]},"createdTimestamp":1715664024745,"updatedTimestamp":1719564743378}
