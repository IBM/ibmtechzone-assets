- answer: "Hello! I'm here to help you with this age-related problem. Let's break\
    \ it down step by step:\n\n1\\. We know that Louise is 26 years old and her daughter\
    \ Carmen is 4 years old.\n2\\. We want to find out in how many years Louise will\
    \ be double her daughter\u2019s age. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\
    \ Louise's age + Time  = 2 \\* ( Carmen's age + Time)\n3 . To find out in how\
    \ many years Louise will be double her daughter\u2019s age, we need to put the\
    \ values of Carmen's age: 4 and Louise's age =  26 \n4\\. So we need to solve:\
    \ 26 + Time  = 2 \\* ( 4 + Time)\n4\\.  Solving this equations gives Time = 18\n\
    \nTherefore, it will take Louise 18 years to be double her daughter\u2019s age.\n"

- answer: 'Hello! I''m here to help you with this age-related problem. Let''s break
    it down step by step:


    1\. We know that Carmen is 12 years older than David. So, Carmen''s age = David''s
    age + 12.

    2\. Five years ago, the sum of their ages was 28. So, (David''s age - 5) + (Carmen''s
    age - 5) = 28.

    3\. We can simplify the equation by combining them: (David''s age - 5) + ( David''s
    age + 12 - 5) = 28.

    4\. Solve for David''s age:  David''s age = (28 - 2) / 2 = 13

    5\. Since Carmen''s age is 12 years older than David, we add 12 to f David''s
    age in order to find Carmen''s age: David''s age  + 12 = 25


    Therefore, David is currently 13 years old and Carmen is currently 25 years old.
