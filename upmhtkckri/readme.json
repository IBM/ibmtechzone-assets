It combines embeddings from both text and image data, enabling hybrid searches based on a user-provided query. \nFunction: query_milvus_multimodal\nParameters\n\n    query: (str) The input text for search queries.\n    sub_product_group: (str) The specific subcategory of products to narrow down search results. Example: \"Armchair\", \"Beds\".\n    num_results: (int) The number of results to return.\n    img_weight: (float, optional) Weight applied to image similarity during search ranking. Default is 0.2.\n    desc_weight: (float, optional) Weight applied to description similarity during search ranking. Default is 0.1.\n    generated_query_weight: (float, optional) Weight for generated query similarity during search ranking. Default is 0.7.\n    milvus_creds:(dictionary) Milvus credentials with host, port and password\n\n    The function returns a ranked list of search results (hybrid_res), combining image, description, and generated query similarity according to the provided weights.","typeId":1,"type":"python","fileName":"upmhtkckri.py","source":"local","assetURL":"","userId":"393bd77f-9fb6-4448-a41b-4de228dfb0b9","preRequisites":{"fields":[{"type":"text","label":"milvus_creds"},{"type":"text","label":"query"},{"type":"text","label":"sub_product_group"},{"type":"text","label":"num_results"}],"requiredFields":[["milvus_creds","query","sub_product_group","num_results"]],"installDependencyCommands":["pymilvus==2.4.5"," sentence-transformers==3.0.1"]},"createdTimestamp":1727241164256,"updatedTimestamp":1727241580544}
